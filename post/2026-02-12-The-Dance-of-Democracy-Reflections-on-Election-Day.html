        Today, February 12, 2026, Bangladesh went to the polls.
    </p>

    <p>
        Walking through my neighborhood this morning, I saw something unexpected: people were <em>happy</em>. Families in their finest clothes, chai wallahs (Tea sellers) doing brisk business, groups of friends debating near polling stations with animated (GIF) gestures and laughter. The air carried that peculiar energy, part festival, part competition. Flags in two dominant colors fluttered from rickshaws, balconies, and even the occasional stray dog who seemed confused by all the attention.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was, by all external measures, a celebration of democracy.
    </p>

    <p>
        And yet, I found myself uneasy.
    </p>
    <h2>Election Engagement Over Time</h2>

        Voter participation this year reached its highest recorded level in recent history, reflecting renewed public interest and political reawakening.

    <h2>The Comfort of the Binary</h2>

    <p>
        There is something seductive about two-party systems. They simplify the messy, kaleidoscopic nature of human society into a clean binary. Us vs. them. Progressive vs. conservative. The party of the tiger vs. the party of the boat. It gives people a shorthand—a way to understand politics without needing a political science degree. You pick a color, you pick a symbol, and suddenly you belong to something larger than yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
        But belonging, when purchased at the cost of complexity, becomes a kind of cage.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "The two-party system is the political version of arranged marriage. It promises stability but often delivers compromise without passion, commitment without choice."

    <p>
        Today, as I watched voters emerge from booths with inked fingers raised like trophies, I couldn't shake the feeling that we've mistaken participation for power. We voted. We chose. But between two predetermined options, how much are we really deciding?
    </p>

    <h2>The Divides We Build</h2>

    <p>
        The most visible cost of binary democracy is division. Not the healthy disagreement of neighbors, but the kind that calcifies into identity. When your political party becomes your tribe, the opponent ceases to be a fellow citizen with differing views and becomes an adversary to be defeated. Campaign rhetoric that began as policy disagreement metastasizes into personal animosity.
    </p>

    <p>
        I watched families sit at the same dinner table today but refuse to discuss politics. Not out of peace, but out of fear. Friendships strained. Social media timelines transformed into battlegrounds. The very mechanism designed to represent the people's will has, in some ways, turned us against each other.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not unique to Bangladesh. It is the quiet pathology of two-party democracy everywhere.
    </p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
        We have learned to celebrate election day while forgetting that the day after, we must still live together.
    </div>

    <h2>Voices Across Time</h2>

    <p>
        History offers us both celebration and warning. Democracy's greatest defenders have also been its sharpest critics, not to destroy it, but to save it from itself.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plato (c. 375 BCE):</strong> "Democracy... is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike." His caution: democracy can degenerate into tyranny when freedom becomes license.</li>

        <li><strong>Winston Churchill (1947):</strong> "Democracy is the worst form of government — except for all the others that have been tried." Perhaps the most honest defense ever offered.</li>

        <li><strong>Margaret Thatcher (1980s):</strong> "Consensus is the negation of leadership." A reminder that majority rule can suppress necessary dissent.</li>

        <li><strong>Aung San Suu Kyi (1990s):</strong> "Freedom of opinion is not just a right but a duty." Yet her own later years remind us that democracy's champions can become its cautionary tales.</li>

        <li><strong>Rabindranath Tagore (1931):</strong> "A mind all logic is like a knife all blade. It makes the hand bleed that uses it." The poet's warning against reductionist thinking; applicable to politics as much as philosophy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        What these voices share is not skepticism of democracy itself, but of democracy <em>unexamined</em>. Democracy that has become ritual rather than reflection.
    </p>

    <h2>What Democracy Could Be</h2>

    <p>
        I don't write this to suggest that elections are meaningless, or that two-party democracy is without merit. It has brought stability where chaos once reigned. It has given voice to millions who were once voiceless. My inked finger today was not a lie. It was hope.
    </p>

    <p>
        But hope is not the same as complacency.
    </p>

    <p>
        What if democracy demanded more from us than a vote every five years? What if civic participation meant engaging with complexity rather than outsourcing it to party manifestos? What if we measured the health of our democracy not by voter turnout alone, but by our willingness to listen across divides, to hold nuance, to reject the comfort of easy enemies?
    </p>

    <p>
        The two-party system gives us clarity. Perhaps what we need is courage... to demand more than two choices, to resist the tribalism that masquerades as loyalty, to remember that the neighbor who voted differently is still our neighbor.
    </p>

    <h2>An Honest Question</h2>

    <p>
        Tonight, as the results begin to trickle in, I find myself less interested in who won and more interested in how we will be tomorrow. Will we wake up still divided? Will the celebrations and concessions be followed by genuine dialogue? Will we remember that democracy is not a destination but a continuous, difficult practice?
    </p>

    <p>
        I don't have answers. This post is not a manifesto; it's an invitation. To question. To reflect. To refuse the false comfort of binary thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today we voted. Tomorrow, perhaps, we can begin the harder work of actually listening to each other.
    </p>

    <h3>Postscript: On Writing This</h3>

    <p>
        This post was unusual for me. I even tell others to not get in politics. I typically write about code, design, and the quiet joy of building things that work. Politics feels messier, less certain. I drafted this by hand first, then worked with AI to structure the arguments and find the historical references I knew existed but couldn't precisely locate. The final edit, the tone, the local context, the decision to post at all remained mine.
    </p>

    <p>
        I disclose this because transparency matters, especially when writing about democracy. We should know how our information is made.
