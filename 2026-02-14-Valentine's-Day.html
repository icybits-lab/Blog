    <p>Today was Valentine's Day. The day of love, roses, overpriced dinners, and couples walking around like they've discovered something the rest of us haven't.</p>
    
    <p>I woke up, scrolled through social media for approximately 30 seconds before the sheer volume of couple photos made me put my phone down and decide: <em>I need to get out of the house.</em></p>

    <div class="status-card">
        <i class="fas fa-user"></i> <strong>Status:</strong> Single, available, and currently taking offers. Applications can be submitted via the social links below. Must enjoy tea extremely sweet and tolerate my terrible jokes.
    </div>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Escaping to Paharpur</h2>
    
    <p>I decided to visit the Paharpur Buddhist Vihara in Naogaon. It's been about 2 years since I went there last. A UNESCO World Heritage site, dating back to the 8th century. Ancient bricks, peaceful stupas, centuries of history baked into every wall. The kind of place where you'd expect to find monks meditating, not...</p>
    
    <p>Well. Not what I actually found.</p>

    <div class="image-placeholder">
        <i class="fas fa-tree" style="font-size: 3rem; opacity: 0.5;"></i>
        <p><em>The ancient ruins of Paharpur — or as it's known today: Couples' Paradise 2026</em></p>
    </div>

    <p>I arrived around noon. The drive itself was beautiful. Green fields, rural Bangladesh doing what it does best, looking effortlessly picturesque. I was feeling peaceful. Centered. Ready to absorb some history and maybe take some photos for insta</p>
    
    <p>Then I saw the parking lot.</p>
    
    <p>Motorcycles everywhere. Not just any motorcycles. The kind with two helmets, both matching, usually with a heart sticker somewhere. Couples walking hand-in-hand toward the entrance. Groups of couples, like some kind of romantic migration pattern.</p>

    <h2>The Great Valentine's Migration</h2>
    
    <p>Turns out, Paharpur on Valentine's Day is apparently <em>the</em> spot. Who knew? Certainly not me, the single guy who thought "ancient Buddhist ruins" would be a safe haven from romance.</p>
    
    <p>Walking through the site, I saw them everywhere:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Couples taking selfies in front of the main stupa</li>
        <li>Couples sitting on ancient bricks like they were park benches</li>
        <li>Couples walking slowly, holding hands, doing that thing where they stop to look at each other every 30 seconds (you know the thing)</li>
        <li>One couple having a picnic on what I'm pretty sure is a protected archaeological area (I didn't say anything)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>And me. Just me. Walking alone, taking photos of bricks, accidentally photobombing someone's romantic moment at least three times.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Being single on Valentine's Day in Bangladesh means you either stay home and watch movies, or you become an unintentional observer of other people's romance. I chose the latter and got a history lesson with a side of existential reflection.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> The BGB Presence</h2>
    
    <p>Now here's where it got interesting.</p>
    
    <p>The Bangladesh Border Guard was out in full force. And I don't mean a few guys standing around. I'm talking patrols. Actual patrols, walking through the ruins, scanning the treeline, keeping watch like they were guarding the border itself.</p>
    
    <p>At first I thought something was wrong. Security threat? Political tension? Then I overheard a conversation between two BGB soldiers:</p>
    
    <p style="padding-left: 20px; border-left: 3px solid #3498db; font-style: italic;">
        "Any activity?"<br>
        "Just couples. Chased them away from the woods near the north wall."<br>
        "Try the east side. Saw some movement near the trees."<br>
        "Copy."
    </p>
    
    <p>And it clicked.</p>
    
    <p>The BGB wasn't there to protect the ruins from terrorists. They were there to protect the ruins from <em>couples</em>. Or more specifically, to protect public decency from couples looking for a private spot in a very public place.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
        Valentine's Day in Bangladesh: where ancient Buddhist ruins become romantic hotspots and border guards become romance patrol.
    </div>

    <p>I watched a young couple get gently but firmly escorted out of a particularly secluded corner near the eastern wall. The girl was embarrassed. The guy looked defeated. The BGB soldier looked like he'd done this a hundred times today. Probably had.</p>
    
    <p>It was simultaneously hilarious and strangely sweet. The guards weren't mean about it, just firm. "Public place, sir. Please stay in the main area." The unspoken message: <em>We know what you're trying to do. Find a hotel like everyone else.</em></p>

    <h2>A Buddhist Temple on Valentine's Day</h2>
    
    <p>There's something quietly poetic about it. A place built for meditation and detachment from worldly desires, overrun by people celebrating exactly those desires. The ancient monks would probably have some thoughts.</p>
    
    <p>I sat on a broken wall for a while, just watching. The couples, the guards, the occasional bewildered tourist (just me, I was the bewildered tourist). The afternoon sun hitting the bricks, turning them gold. It was beautiful, even with the romance overload.</p>
    
    <p>I'm not Buddhist. I was just there for the history. But I felt... not peaceful exactly, but something adjacent to it. Like being alone in a crowd of couples wasn't a sad thing, just a different thing. They were having their day. I was having mine.</p>

    <h2>The Walk Back</h2>
    
    <p>On my way out, I passed a couple sitting on a low wall near the exit. They were young, early twenties, maybe. The girl was fixing the guy's collar. He was holding a single red rose, slightly wilted from the heat. They weren't taking photos or being loud. Just sitting together, quiet.</p>
    
    <p>It was the least performative couple I'd seen all day. And honestly? It was nice. Gave me a tiny sliver of hope that maybe this whole love thing isn't entirely about social media validation.</p>
    
    <p>Still single though. Still taking offers.</p>
