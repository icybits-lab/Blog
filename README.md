### My Personal Blog

A simple, elegant personal blog built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This blog loads content dynamically from text and HTML files, with no database or backend required.

### 📖 About This Blog

This is my personal space on the web where I share thoughts, ideas, and experiences about web development, technology, and life. The blog is intentionally simple yet functional, demonstrating what can be built with just the core web technologies.

### 🏗️ How It Works

File Structure

```
/
├── index.html          # Main page layout
├── style.css           # All styling
├── script.js           # Blog logic
├── posts.json          # List of post filenames
└── post/               # Contains blog posts
    └── [post-files]
```

### Adding New Posts

1. Create a new file in the post/ directory
   · Format: YYYY-MM-DD-Post-Title.txt (or .html)
   · Example: 2026-02-10-Learning-JavaScript.txt
2. Add the filename to posts.json
3. That's it! The blog automatically loads and displays it

3. Loaded instantly
4. Was easy to maintain and update
5. Showcased what's possible with vanilla web technologies
